Cancer Cell Classification using Machine Learning

Overview

This project aims to classify cancer cells as either malignant or benign using machine learning techniques. By analyzing cell features, we can build a predictive model that assists in early cancer detection.

Dataset

- We used the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset** from the sklearn library
- The dataset contains features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.
- Features include mean radius, texture, smoothness, and more.
- The target variable is the diagnosis (Malignant or Benign).
